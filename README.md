# Revert Test

In this lab, we'll use `git revert` to revert a commit.

## Introduction

If you mess up or the commit history between two copies of the same repo become out of sync, you may need to revert.

## Testing the Revert

Check out this code:


```python
def function(var1):
    var1 = 'hi'
    return var1

function('bye')
```




    'hi'



## Second Test
This is the second test:


```python
def function2(var2):
    var2 = str(var2)
    var2 += ' blah'
    return var2

function2(1)
```




    '1 blah'



## Conclusions
Writing this code here so that I can remove it later maybe if this works. 

## OK NOW THIS IS THE SECTION THAT I WILL REMOVE
FOR REAL FOR REAL FOR REAL
